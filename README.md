This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to type coercion. The function `foo` intends to return `null` if either `a` or `b` is `null`. However, due to JavaScript's loose typing and automatic type coercion, unexpected results might occur. For example, if you pass `'0'` and `1` it unexpectedly produces `'01'` instead of `1`.  This illustrates the importance of explicit type checking when dealing with `null` values in JavaScript.
